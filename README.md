Support Vector Machines are a very popular type of machine learning model used for classification when you have a small dataset.


### 3. Second order Optimization

Newton's Method uses the 2nd derivative for optimizing, which hints at a graphs curvature, has better step-wise performance, but is usually outperformed by gradient descent because computing the 2nd derivative is computationally expensive.


### 4. Logistic Regression

We're going to use logistic regression to predict if someone has diabetes or not given 3 body metrics! We'll use Newton's method to help us optimize the model. We'll use a bit from all the mathematical disciplines i've mentioned (calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, statistics).
