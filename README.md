### 2. Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines are a very popular type of machine learning model used for classification when you have a small dataset.


### 3. Second order Optimization

Newton's Method uses the 2nd derivative for optimizing, which hints at a graphs curvature, has better step-wise performance, but is usually outperformed by gradient descent because computing the 2nd derivative is computationally expensive.


### 4. Logistic Regression

We're going to use logistic regression to predict if someone has diabetes or not given 3 body metrics! We'll use Newton's method to help us optimize the model. We'll use a bit from all the mathematical disciplines i've mentioned (calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, statistics). 


### 5. Vectors

Basically, its just 2 pieces of code that I used to show an example. One compares the dot product operation to standard multiplication to show how linear algebra is faster when we have several numbers to calculate simultaneously. The other is just a simple neural network to show that vectors don't just represent data, they represent our model's learnings.


### 6. k-Means Clustering

Let's detect the intruder trying to break into our security system using a very popular ML technique called K-Means Clustering! This is an example of learning from data that has no labels (unsupervised) and we'll use some concepts that we've already learned about like computing the Euclidean distance and a loss function to do this.
